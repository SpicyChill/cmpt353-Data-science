1. Which model did the best for the colour-prediction task? Can you give a theory about why? 
 	The KNN model does the best job. From the result we can get, also KNN is trying to get nearest five points surrounding which make more sense.


Bayesian classifier:    0.534 0.534
kNN classifier:         0.711 0.711
Rand forest classifier: 0.709 0.720

2.Yes I think model makes reasonably mistake, because city like edmonton and calgary should have similar weather, maybe we can add longitude and latitude as feature add make model more reliable.
